# Hi There

I'm **Philipp Haustein** and currently studing **Media Informatics Bachelor** 
at 
[Beuth University](https://www.beuth-hochschule.de/) 
in Berlin.
I'm currently also working at the
[DATEXIS](http://prof.beuth-hochschule.de/loeser/)
research group.
This is a little Website of the different [Projects](/featured_projects.html) I have implemented in my
free time or university.

Even thought I'm currently working in Datascince I'm more interested in game
engineering and computer graphics. 
If you have any questions or your company is currenty hiring game engineers 
please feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn]() or by [e-mail]().
