# Hi There

I’m **Philipp Haustein** and currently studying **Media Informatics Bachelor** at [Beuth University](https://www.beuth-hochschule.de/)  in Berlin. I’m currently also working at the [DATEXIS](http://prof.beuth-hochschule.de/loeser/) research group. This is a little Website of the different [Projects](/featured_projects.html) I have implemented in my free time or university.

Even though I’m currently working in Data science I’m more interested in game engineering and computer graphics. If you have any questions or your company is currently hiring game engineers please feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipp-haustein-934010198/) or by [e-mail](mailto:haustein-philipp@web.de).
