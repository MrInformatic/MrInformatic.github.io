## About

<!--excerpt.start-->

This project is the prototype of a dungeon crawler where the player defends himself against an evil hodes of dungeon monsters. This is a solo project which I developed a few months back using Java and LibGDX. Everything you can see from the sprite, the tilemap to the enemy props was created by myself.


## Featues

 * 4-way animated player
 * animated enemies
 * torch lighting
 * color changing energy and health bars
 * an action bar with cooldown visualization

This is a solo project of mine developed quite a while ago using Java and LibGDX. Everything you see is created by me, all the sprites, the tilemap, enemys, props. I've developed everything myself.
