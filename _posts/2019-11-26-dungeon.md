## About

<!--excerpt.start-->

This project is a prototype of a dungeon crawler where you play as a mage to defend yourself against the evil hordes of dungeon monsters. This is a solo project of mine developed quite a while ago using Java and LibGDX. Everything you see is created by me, all the sprites, the tilemap, enemies, props. I've developed everything myself.


## Featues

 * 4-way animated player
 * animated enemies
 * torch lighting
 * color changing energy and health bars
 * an action bar with cooldown visualization.
