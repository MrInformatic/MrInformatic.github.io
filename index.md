# Hi There

My name is **Philipp Haustein**. I am currently employed at [Sandbox Interactive](https://albiononline.com/home) to work the sandbox MMORPG [Albion Online](https://albiononline.com/home) as a UI Coder. I have studied **media informatics** at [Beuth University](https://www.beuth-hochschule.de/) in Berlin. I have also worked at:

I have a professional background in both data sciences and, game engineering. Feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipp-haustein-934010198/) or by [e-mail](mailto:haustein-philipp@web.de) if you have any questions or if you want to work with me professionally. 

Now that you are here, I would be happy to show you some of the [projects](/featured_projects.html) I have implemented in my free-time, in university and professionally.
