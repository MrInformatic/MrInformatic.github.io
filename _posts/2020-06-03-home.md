# Hi There

My name is **Philipp Haustein**. I am a bachelor student in **media informatics** at [Beuth University](https://www.beuth-hochschule.de/) in Berlin and currently also working at the [DATEXIS](http://prof.beuth-hochschule.de/loeser/) research group. Now that you are here, I would be happy to show you some of the [projects](/featured_projects.html) I have implemented in my free-time and in university.

My professional back ground is mostly in data sciences, but I would like to find an entry into game engineering and computer graphics as this is more in line with my interests and skills. Feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipp-haustein-934010198/) or by [e-mail](mailto:haustein-philipp@web.de) if you have any questions or if your company is currently hiring junior engineers or interns in one of the mentioned departments.
